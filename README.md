> The **"Google Assistant Unofficial Desktop Client"** is in `beta` and under development. So, if you find any bugs or have any suggestion, feel free to post an _issue_ or a _pull request_.

## Inspiration

The design is inspired by Google Assistant in Chrome OS except that it's all black ðŸ˜‰.

## Getting Started

In order to use the client, you must have a _"Key File"_ and _"Token"_ for authentication which you can get by going through **Device Registration** process.

If you want a user friendly registration method, use Device Registration UI:
> https://developers.google.com/assistant/sdk/guides/library/python/embed/config-dev-project-and-account

If you want to use a CLI tool to complete the registration process manually, read the following:
> https://developers.google.com/assistant/sdk/reference/device-registration/register-device-manual

After you have registered your device and downloaded the required authentication files, you can head on to _Settings_ and set the _"Key File Path"_ and _"Saved Tokens Path"_ to the location where the respective files are located.
